# Troubleshooting common work-from-home computer issues

## Intro

### What you'll need to know to use this document.

#### Keyboard


##### Individual keys

Individual keystrokes are illustrated in a rounded box for example <kbd>F</kbd> indicates that you should press the 'F' key.

##### The Windows key

The Windows key is typically located between <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> is shown as

<kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd>

Pressing this once will bring up the Windows menu; there are also a
number of useful keyboard shortcuts that incorporate it.

##### Keyboard combinations

Certain key combinations are 'chorded', meaning that you will press and hold each of the keys before releasing all of them. This is indicated by a '+' between the keystrokes. If you see

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>

This means press and hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> then press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

Sometimes keyboard combinations are followed by other keys, e.g. 

<kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd>

Means press and hold <kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd> press <kbd>X</kbd> and release both keys. *Then* press <kbd>E</kbd>. This looks complicated when written out, but isn't hard when you actually type it.

##### Useful keyboard shortcuts

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> -- Launch the windows task manager.
* <kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> -- This is the same as right-clicking on <kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd>; there are a number of useful tools (with corresponding keyboard shortcuts) under this menu.
* <kbd>&#x229e; Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd> -- File explorer.
